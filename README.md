UCSD Data Science Bootcamp - Tableau Homework

## Purpose
Build practice and confidence in working with Tableau to build interactive dashboards and compelling storyboards. This Repo contains the data cleaning needed prior to importing to Tableau. This project is fictional and for academic purposes.

## Premise
Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program. Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Usage
The raw data was captured from [CitiBikeNYC](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). It is stored here in the form of zip files in the Resources folder. Before the cleaning file can be run, the files will need to be unzipped to their original csv form.

## Timeline
This will likely not have many updates going forward.
